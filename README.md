# What's the weather like? 
## A back-end mini-project

Main learning goals:
- sanitise and validate a simple form in Express
- query an API from the Express server (no client-side 'fetch' etc)

Basic functionality:
- search form to get city name from user
- sanitise and validate input
- query a weather API (e.g. OpenWeatherMap)
- display a concise weather description for the city
- on errors, display errors message and re-render the search form


Key tools used:
- Node, Express
- rendering: handlebars
- validation: express-validator
- weather API provided by: OpenWeatherMap
- making API requests: node-fetch
